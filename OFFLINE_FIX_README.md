# Electron App Offline Fix

## Problem Solved
The Electron application was failing to start on computers without internet connectivity because it required fetching credentials from a remote server.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added offline fallback credentials** in `desktop/server.js`
2. **Enhanced credential configuration** in `data/credential-config.json` with offline mode support
3. **Graceful degradation** - the app now works in the following order:
   - Try cached credentials (if available)
   - Try fetching fresh credentials from server (if online)
   - Fall back to offline/placeholder credentials (if offline)

## Files Modified
- `desktop/server.js` - Added `getDefaultCredentials()` function with offline support
- `data/credential-config.json` - Added `offlineMode` configuration

## Testing Results
✅ App now starts successfully even without internet connection
✅ Server starts on port 3456
✅ Next.js application loads properly
✅ API endpoints respond correctly

## Distribution
The fixed version is available in:
- `dist/win-ia32-unpacked/` - 32-bit Windows version
- `dist/win-unpacked/` - 64-bit Windows version (if available)

## How to Use
1. Copy the entire `dist/win-ia32-unpacked/` folder to the target computer
2. Run `PrimeZone Advanced Panorama Viewer.exe`
3. The app will start even without internet connectivity

## Note
When running offline, the app uses placeholder Supabase credentials. For full functionality with cloud features, an internet connection is still recommended.
